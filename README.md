# Lambda School Data Science - Unit 2 - Sprint 3


# Applied Modeling

For your portfolio project, you will choose your own labeled, tabular dataset, train a predictive model, and publish a web app or blog post with visualizations to explain your model.

You will use your chosen dataset for all assignments during the Applied Modeling sprint.

You’ll learn how to define machine learning problems, begin the modeling process, choose targets, choose evaluation metrics, and avoid leakage.

You’ll improve your model predictions with powerful models like gradient boosting and feature selection techniques like permutation importance.

You’ll improve your model interpretation with insightful visualizations like partial dependence plots and shapley value force plots.

Applying predictive modeling to real decisions isn’t easy, but these are the skills employers are looking for!
